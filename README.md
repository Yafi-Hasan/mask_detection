- Not wearing a mask
- Properly wearing a mask
- Not properly wearing a mask (only covered the mouth, not the nose)

The classification algorithm used in this project is customize MobileNet-V2 computer vision, machine learning, architecture. 2340 images used for training and testing process (780 images for each class). 85% images used for training and 15% images used for testing. The images used to train the model comes from three different datasets. Those datasets are:
-
